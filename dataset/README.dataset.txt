### This project was created by downloading the GTSDB German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark
### dataset from Kaggle and importing the annotated training set files (images and annotation files)
### to Roboflow.

* Original home of the dataset: https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=dataset - [Institut Für Neuroinformatik](https://www.ini.rub.de/)

The annotation files were adjusted to conform to the [YOLO Keras TXT format](https://roboflow.com/formats/yolo-keras-txt) prior to upload, as the original format did not include a [label map file](https://blog.roboflow.com/label-map/).

`v1` contains the original imported images, without augmentations. This is the version to download and import to your own project if you'd like to add your own augmentations.

`v2` contains an augmented version of the dataset, with annotations. This version of the project was trained with Roboflow's "FAST" model.

`v3` contains an augmented version of the dataset, with annotations. This version of the project was trained with Roboflow's "ACCURATE" model.
